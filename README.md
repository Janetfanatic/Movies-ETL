# Movies-ETL

### The completion of this module was a long an tidious task and every element appears to be essential to the completion of the project.  The challenge however demonstated that while printing DataFrames and polting graphs allow for improved understanding of the data as it transformed into information, it is not essential to have at the conclusion.  Removing these non-essential elements removes distractons and improves a reviewer's understanding of how the data has been transformed. In addition, trouble shooting errors also becomes easier because relationships are easily found. An indiviual streamling code must be alert during this process, it is easy to remove pieces of vital code, I feel victim to this during this challenge.  It is important to keep an unaltered copy of the orginal code handy and utilize it as a reference.  Test, test, and re-test,  to ensure the code it working and running, you must check for errors after ever modification to ensure the project is perfect.  There are some problems that are unpredictable, I was unable to utilize my dependencies in VS Code,  testing the extract,transform and load,  required coping the code into Pandas.

## As this was my first time attemping to create a ETL pipline, I assumed that I would encounter error messages along the way.
## Errors I assumed I would encounter included:
## 1. syntax error
## 2. value error
## 3. indent error
## 4. failue to load
## 5. This table already exists
## My assumptions were mostly correct, I received four out of the five errors.  In addition to these errors, I recieved additional errors including undefined vaiable engine, anomalous backslash in string, file not found and unable to import required dependencies. While completing this assignment in VS code I was able to resolve all but one, I am stil unable to resolve the dependencies issue but the code runs fine in Jypter Notebook.
