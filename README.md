### The completion of this module was a long an tidious task and every element appears to be essential to the completion of the project.  The challenge however demonstated that while printing DataFrames and polting graphs allow for improved understanding of the data as it transformed into information, it is not essential to have at the conclusion.  Removing these non-essential elements removes distractons and improves a reviewer's understanding of how the data has been transformed. In addition, trouble shooting errors also becomes easier because relationships are easily found. An indiviual streamling code must be alert during this process, it is easy to remove pieces of vital code, I feel victim to this during this challenge.  It is important to keep an unaltered copy of the orginal code handy and utilize it as a reference.  Test, test, and re-test,  to ensure the code it working and running, you must check for errors after ever modification to ensure the project is perfect.  There are some problems that are unpredictable, I was unable to utilize my dependencies in VS Code,  testing the extract,transform and load,  required coping the code into Pandas.
